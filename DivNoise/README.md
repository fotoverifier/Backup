# DivNoise | A tool for camera model identification
DivNoise is hosted at [www.divnoise.fotoverifier.eu](https://www.divnoise.fotoverifier.eu) and consists of three functionalities: 
- Single image analysis (upload an image and find out the camera model)
- Multiple image analysis (upload a set of images and check whether they come from the same camera model)
- Camera matching (provide a set of images taken with the same camera model to compute the 'fingerprint of the model', and a query image to be compared with the fingerprint in order to check whether they come from the same camera model)

For the analysis, the [noiseprint method](https://github.com/grip-unina/noiseprint) has been used.In terms of camera models, we included not only the DivNoise models, but also a few models from the [VISION dataset](https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1186/s13635-017-0067-2.pdf) and the [FORCHHEIM dataset](https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/The-Forchheim-Image-Database-for-Camera-in-the-Wild-Hadwiger-Riess/d1996194f350ad52dfe185d46581d38176441ce5)
